Programming Conventions 
=======================
This document is made to help list different variable prefixes in a program; to tell the programmer what a variable is, inside a script.

Put these to the left of the name desired, followed by an underscore, to make it easier to know what each object made is, like so:

DIR_Save -> Save Directory
QUE_ClientInfo -> Client Info Queue

It works similar to how file extensions tell us what kind of files they are, by telling what kind of information a statement is in a program. This is optional and you can even use your own, but in extremely large programs with many scripts filled with many lines, this can be more than helpful!
